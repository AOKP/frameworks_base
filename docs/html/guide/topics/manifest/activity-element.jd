<dt>description:</dt>
<dd itemprop="description">Declares an activity (an {@link android.app.Activity} subclass) that
implements part of the application's visual user interface.  All activities
must be represented by {@code <activity>}
elements in the manifest file.  Any that are not declared there will not be seen
by the system and will never be run.

<dt>attributes:</dt>
<dd><dl class="attr">
<dt><a name="embedded"></a>{@code android:allowEmbedded}</dt>
<dd>
    Indicate that the activity can be launched as the embedded child of another
    activity. Particularly in the case where the child lives in a container
    such as a Display owned by another activity. For example, activities
    that are used for Wear custom notifications must declare this so
    Wear can display the activity in it's context stream, which resides
    in another process.

    <p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.
</dd>
<dt><a name="reparent"></a>{@code android:allowTaskReparenting}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to
the task it has an affinity for when that task is next brought to the
front &mdash; "{@code true}" if it can move, and "{@code false}" if it
must remain with the task where it started.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute of the <code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element
applies to the activity.  The default value is "{@code false}".
</p>

<p>
Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of
the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime.
You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it
has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed.
Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move
to the main task associated with that application.
</p>

<p>
For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking
the link brings up an activity that can display the page.  That activity
is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task.  If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the
browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task
again comes forward.
</p>

<p>
The affinity of an activity is defined by the
<code><a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a></code> attribute.  The affinity
of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity.
Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the
same affinity.  Since activities with "{@code singleTask}" or
"{@code singleInstance}" launch modes can only be at the root of a task,
re-parenting is limited to the "{@code standard}" and "{@code singleTop}"
modes.  (See also the <code><a href="#lmode">launchMode</a></code>
attribute.)
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="always"></a>{@code android:alwaysRetainTaskState}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the state of the task that the activity is in will always
be maintained by the system &mdash; "{@code true}" if it will be, and
"{@code false}" if the system is allowed to reset the task to its initial
state in certain situations.  The default value is "{@code false}".  This
attribute is meaningful only for the root activity of a task; it's ignored
for all other activities.

<p>
Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack
above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that
task from the home screen.  Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited
the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
However, when this attribute is "{@code true}", users will always return
to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there.  This is
useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is
a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="autoremrecents"></a>{@code android:autoRemoveFromRecents}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not tasks launched by activities with this attribute remains in the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a> until the last activity in the
task is completed. If {@code true}, the task is
automatically removed from the overview screen. This overrides the caller's use of
{@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS}. It must be a boolean value, either
"{@code true}" or "{@code false}".</dd>


<dt><a name="banner"></a>{@code android:banner}</dt>
<dd>A <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html">drawable resource</a>
providing an extended graphical banner for its associated item. Use with the
{@code <activity>} tag to supply a default banner for a specific activity, or with the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html"><code>&lt;application&gt;</code></a>
tag to supply a banner for all application activities.

<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
{@link android.content.Intent#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER} intent.</p>

<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example {@code "@drawable/banner"}). There is no default banner.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="{@docRoot}design/tv/patterns.html#banner">
Banners</a> in the UI Patterns for TV design guide, and <a href="{@docRoot}training/tv/start/start.html#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p></dd>


<dt><a name="clear"></a>{@code android:clearTaskOnLaunch}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not all activities will be removed from the task, except for
the root activity, whenever it is re-launched from the home screen &mdash;
"{@code true}" if the task is always stripped down to its root activity, and
"{@code false}" if not.  The default value is "{@code false}".  This attribute
is meaningful only for activities that start a new task (the root activity);
it's ignored for all other activities in the task.

<p>
When the value is "{@code true}", every time users start the task again, they
are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in
the task and regardless of whether they used the <em>Back</em> or <em>Home</em> button to
leave it. When the value is "{@code false}", the task may be cleared of activities in
some situations (see the
<code><a href="#always">alwaysRetainTaskState</a></code> attribute), but not always.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen,
and from there goes to activity Q.  The user next presses <em>Home</em>, and then returns
to activity P.  Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they
were last doing in P's task.  However, if P set this flag to "{@code true}", all
of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed
<em>Home</em> and the task went to the background.  So the user sees only P when returning
to the task.
</p>

<p>
If this attribute and <code><a href="#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "{@code true}", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to
the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped,
as described above.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="config"></a>{@code android:configChanges}</dt>
<dd>Lists configuration changes that the activity will handle itself.  When a configuration
change occurs at runtime, the activity is shut down and restarted by default, but declaring a
configuration with this attribute will prevent the activity from being restarted. Instead, the
activity remains running and its <code>{@link android.app.Activity#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)
onConfigurationChanged()}</code> method is called.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using this attribute should be
avoided and used only as a last resort. Please read <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">Handling Runtime Changes</a> for more
information about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change.</p>

<p>
Any or all of the following strings are valid values for this attribute. Multiple values are
separated by '{@code |}' &mdash; for example, "{@code locale|navigation|orientation}".

your activity, even when running on an Android 3.2 or higher device).

 </tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code smallestScreenSize}"</td>
   <td>The physical screen size has changed. This represents a change in size regardless of

</table>

<p>
All of these configuration changes can impact the resource values seen by the
application.  Therefore, when <code>{@link android.app.Activity#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)
onConfigurationChanged()}</code> is called, it will generally be necessary to again
retrieve all resources (including view layouts, drawables, and so on) to correctly
handle the change.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="dlmode"></a>{@code android:documentLaunchMode}</dt>
<dd>Specifies how a new instance of an activity should be added to a task each time it is
launched. This attribute permits the user to have multiple documents from the same application
appear in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a>.

<p>This attribute has four values which produce the following effects when the user opens a document
with the application:</p>

<table>

  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Description</th>

</tr><tr>
    <td>"{@code always}"</td>

    and {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK} flags.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>"{@code none}"</td>
    <td>The activity does not create a new task for the activity. This is the default value, which
    creates a new task only when {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} is set.
    The overview screen treats the activity as it would by default: it displays a single task for
    the app, which resumes from whatever activity the user last invoked.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>"{@code never}"</td>
    <td>This activity is not launched into a new document even if the Intent contains
    {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT}. Setting this overrides the behavior
    of the {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT} and
    {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK} flags, if either of these are set in
    the activity, and the overview screen displays a single task for the app, which resumes from
    whatever activity the user last invoked.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For values other than "{@code none}" and "{@code never}" the
activity must be defined with {@code launchMode="standard"}. If this attribute is not specified,
{@code documentLaunchMode="none"} is used.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="enabled"></a>{@code android:enabled}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be instantiated by the system &mdash;
{@code "true"} if it can be, and "{@code false}" if not.  The default value
is "{@code true}".

<p>
The <code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a>
</code> element has its own<code>
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#enabled">enabled</a></code>
attribute that applies to all application components, including activities.  The
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
and {@code <activity>} attributes must both be "{@code true}" (as they both
are by default) for the system to be able to instantiate the activity.  If either
is "{@code false}", it cannot be instantiated.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="exclude"></a>{@code android:excludeFromRecents}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the task initiated by this activity should be excluded from the list of recently
used applications, the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/recents.html">
overview screen</a>. That is, when this activity is the root activity of a new
task, this attribute determines whether the task should not appear in the list of recent apps. Set
"{@code true}" if the task should be <em>excluded</em> from the list; set "{@code false}" if it
should be <em>included</em>. The default value is "{@code false}".
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="exported"></a>{@code android:exported}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be launched by components of other
applications &mdash; "{@code true}" if it can be, and "{@code false}" if not.
If "{@code false}", the activity can be launched only by components of the
same application or applications with the same user ID.

<p>
The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters.  The
absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying
its exact class name.  This implies that the activity is intended only for
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in
this case, the default value is "{@code false}".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity
is intended for external use, so the default value is "{@code true}".
</p>

<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that
can invoke the activity  (see the
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute).
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="finish"></a>{@code android:finishOnTaskLaunch}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not an existing instance of the activity should be shut down
(finished) whenever the user again launches its task (chooses the task on the
home screen) &mdash; "{@code true}" if it should be shut down, and "{@code false}"
if not. The default value is "{@code false}".

<p>
If this attribute and
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "{@code true}", this attribute trumps the other.  The affinity of the
activity is ignored.  The activity is not re-parented, but destroyed.
</p>

<dt><a name="hwaccel"></a>{@code android:hardwareAccelerated}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not hardware-accelerated rendering should be enabled for this
Activity &mdash; "{@code true}" if it should be enabled, and "{@code false}" if
not. The default value is "{@code false}".


<p>Starting from Android 3.0, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. Because of the increased resources required to
enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.</p>

<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="icon"></a>{@code android:icon}</dt>
<dd>An icon representing the activity. The icon is displayed to users when
a representation of the activity is required on-screen.  For example, icons
for activities that initiate tasks are displayed in the launcher window.
The icon is often accompanied by a label (see the <a href="#label">{@code

</p>

<p>
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image definition.  If it is not set, the icon specified for the application

<p>
The activity's icon &mdash; whether set here or by the

<dt><a name="lmode"></a>{@code android:launchMode}</dt>
<dd>An instruction on how the activity should be launched.  There are four modes
that work in conjunction with activity flags ({@code FLAG_ACTIVITY_*} constants)
in {@link android.content.Intent} objects to determine what should happen when
the activity is called upon to handle an intent. They are:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">"{@code standard}"
<br>"{@code singleTop}"
<br>"{@code singleTask}"
<br>"{@code singleInstance}"</p>

<p>
The default mode is "{@code standard}".
</p>

<p>
As shown in the table below, the modes fall into two main groups, with
"{@code standard}" and "{@code singleTop}" activities on one side, and
"{@code singleTask}" and "{@code singleInstance}" activities on the other.
An activity with the "{@code standard}" or "{@code singleTop}" launch mode
can be instantiated multiple times.  The instances can belong to any task
and can be located anywhere in the activity stack.  Typically, they're
launched into the task that called
<code>{@link android.content.Context#startActivity startActivity()}</code>
(unless the Intent object contains a
<code>{@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}</code>
instruction, in which case a different task is chosen &mdash; see the
<a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a> attribute).
</p>

<p>
In contrast, "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities
can only begin a task.  They are always at the root of the activity stack.
Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time
&mdash; only one such task.
</p>

<p>
The "{@code standard}" and "{@code singleTop}" modes differ from each other
in just one respect:  Every time there's a new intent for a "{@code standard}"
activity, a new instance of the class is created to respond to that intent.
Each instance handles a single intent.
Similarly, a new instance of a "{@code singleTop}" activity may also be
created to handle a new intent.  However, if the target task already has an
existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack, that instance
will receive the new intent (in an
{@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent onNewIntent()} call);
a new instance is not created.
In other circumstances &mdash; for example, if an existing instance of the
"{@code singleTop}" activity is in the target task, but not at the top of
the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target task
&mdash; a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if you
<a href="{@docRoot}training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">navigate
up</a> to an activity on the current stack, the behavior is determined by the
parent activity's launch mode. If the parent activity has launch mode {@code
singleTop} (or the <code>up</code> intent contains {@link
android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP}), the parent is brought to the
top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation intent is received
by the parent activity's {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent onNewIntent()}
method.  If the parent activity has launch mode {@code standard} (and the
<code>up</code> intent does not contain {@link
android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP}), the current activity and its
parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of the parent activity
is created to receive the navigation intent.
</p>


<p>
The "{@code singleTask}" and "{@code singleInstance}" modes also differ from
each other in only one respect:  A "{@code singleTask}" activity allows other
activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but
other activities (necessarily "{@code standard}" and "{@code singleTop}"
activities) can be launched into that task.  A "{@code singleInstance}"
activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task.
It's the only activity in the task.  If it starts another activity, that
activity is assigned to a different task &mdash; as if {@code
FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} was in the intent.

<p>As shown in the table above, <code>standard</code> is the default mode and is
appropriate for most types of activities. <code>SingleTop</code> is also a
common and useful launch mode for many types of activities. The other modes
&mdash; <code>singleTask</code> and <code>singleInstance</code> &mdash; are
<span style="color:red">not appropriate for most applications</span>,
since they result in an interaction model that is likely to be unfamiliar to
users and is very different from most other applications.

<p>Regardless of the launch mode that you choose, make sure to test the usability
of the activity during launch and when navigating back to it from
other activities and tasks using the <em>Back</em> button. </p>

<dt><a name="maxrecents"></a>{@code android:maxRecents}</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of tasks rooted at this activity in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/recents.html">
overview screen</a>. When this number of entries is reached, the system removes the least-recently
used instance from the overview screen. Valid values are 1 through 50 (25 on low memory devices);
zero is invalid. This must be an integer value, such as 50. The default value is 16.
</dd>

<dt><a name="multi"></a>{@code android:multiprocess}</dt>
<dd>Whether an instance of the activity can be launched into the process of the component
that started it &mdash; "{@code true}" if it can be, and "{@code false}" if not.
The default value is "{@code false}".

<p>
Normally, a new instance of an activity is launched into the process of the
application that defined it, so all instances of the activity run in the same
process.  However, if this flag is set to "{@code true}", instances of the
activity can run in multiple processes, allowing the system to create instances
wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it), something that is almost
never necessary or desirable.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="nm"></a>{@code android:name}</dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the activity, a subclass of
{@link android.app.Activity}.  The attribute value should be a fully qualified
class name (such as, "{@code com.example.project.ExtracurricularActivity}").
However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a period
(for example, "{@code .ExtracurricularActivity}"), it is appended to the
package name specified in the
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
<p>Once you publish your application, you <a
href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a
href="#exported">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>

<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.

<dd>Whether or not the activity should be removed from the activity stack and

method called) when the user navigates away from it and it's no longer
visible on screen &mdash; "{@code true}" if it should be finished, and
"{@code false}" if not.  The default value is "{@code false}".

<p>
A value of "{@code true}" means that the activity will not leave a
historical trace.  It will not remain in the activity stack for the task,
so the user will not be able to return to it. In this case,
{@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult onActivityResult()} is never called if you
start another activity for a result from this activity.
</p>

<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.
</p>
</dd>

<!-- api level 16 -->
<dt><a name="parent"></a>{@code android:parentActivityName}</dt>
<dd>The class name of the logical parent of the activity. The name here must match the class
  name given to the corresponding {@code <activity>} element's
  <a href="#nm"><code>android:name</code></a> attribute.

<p>The system reads this attribute to determine which activity should be started when
  the user presses the Up button in the action bar. The system can also use this information to
  synthesize a back stack of activities with {@link android.app.TaskStackBuilder}.</p>

<p>To support API levels 4 - 16, you can also declare the parent activity with a {@code
<meta-data>} element that specifies a value for {@code "android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"}.
For example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;activity
    android:name="com.example.app.ChildActivity"
    android:label="@string/title_child_activity"
    android:parentActivityName="com.example.app.MainActivity" >
    &lt;!-- Parent activity meta-data to support API level 4+ -->
    &lt;meta-data
        android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
        android:value="com.example.app.MainActivity" />
&lt;/activity>
</pre>

<p>For more information about declaring the parent activity to support Up navigation,

</dd>



<dt><a name="prmsn"></a>{@code android:permission}</dt>
<dd>The name of a permission that clients must have to launch the activity
or otherwise get it to respond to an intent.  If a caller of
<code>{@link android.content.Context#startActivity startActivity()}</code> or
<code>{@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult startActivityForResult()}</code>
has not been granted the specified permission, its intent will not be
delivered to the activity.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>

For more information on permissions, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html#sectperm">Permissions</a>
section in the introduction and another document,
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and
Permissions</a>.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="proc"></a>{@code android:process}</dt>
<dd>The name of the process in which the activity should run. Normally, all components of an
application run in a default process name created for the application and you do
not need to use this attribute. But if necessary, you can override the default process
name with this attribute, allowing you to spread your app components across
multiple processes.

<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and
the activity runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the activity will run
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing
resource usage.
</p>

<p>The <code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html"
>&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#proc">process</a></code>
attribute can set a different default process name for all components.
</dd>

<dt><a name="relinquish"></a>{@code android:relinquishTaskIdentity}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity relinquishes its task identifiers to an activity above it in the
task stack. A task whose root activity has this attribute set to "{@code true}" replaces the base
Intent with that of the next activity in the task. If the next activity also has this attribute set
to "{@code true}" then it will yield the base Intent to any activity that it launches in the same
task. This continues for each activity until an activity is encountered which has this attribute set
to "{@code false}". The default value is "{@code false}".

<p>This attribute set to "{@code true}" also permits the activity's use of the
{@link android.app.ActivityManager.TaskDescription} to change labels, colors
and icons in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a>.</p>

  element.
</p>

<p>
  If you set this attribute to true, the user can launch the activity in
  split-screen and freeform modes. If you set the attribute to false, the
  activity does not support multi-window mode. If this value is false, and the
  user attempts to launch the activity in multi-window mode, the activity takes

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you declare one of the landscape or portrait values,
it is considered a hard requirement for the orientation in which the activity runs. As such,
the value you declare enables filtering by services such as Google Play so your application is
available only to devices that support the orientation required by your activities. For
example, if you declare either {@code "landscape"}, {@code "reverseLandscape"}, or
{@code "sensorLandscape"}, then your application will be available only to devices that support
landscape orientation. However, you should also explicitly declare that
your application requires either portrait or landscape orientation with the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html">{@code <uses-feature>}</a>
element. For example, <code>&lt;uses-feature
android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"/></code>. This is purely a filtering behavior
provided by Google Play (and other services that support it) and the platform itself does not
control whether your app can be installed when a device supports only certain orientations.</p>

<dt><a name="state"></a>{@code android:stateNotNeeded}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be killed and successfully restarted
without having saved its state &mdash; "{@code true}" if it can be restarted
without reference to its previous state, and "{@code false}" if its previous
state is required.  The default value is "{@code false}".

<p>
Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its
<code>{@link android.app.Activity#onSaveInstanceState onSaveInstanceState()}</code>
method is called.  This method stores the current state of the activity in a
{@link android.os.Bundle} object, which is then passed to
<code>{@link android.app.Activity#onCreate onCreate()}</code> when the activity
is restarted.  If this attribute is set to "{@code true}",
{@code onSaveInstanceState()} may not be called and {@code onCreate()} will
be passed {@code null} instead of the Bundle &mdash; just as it was when the
activity started for the first time.
</p>

<p>
A "{@code true}" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the
absence of retained state.  For example, the activity that displays the
home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it
crashes for some reason.

<dt><a name="aff"></a>{@code android:taskAffinity}</dt>
<dd>The task that the activity has an affinity for.  Activities with
the same affinity conceptually belong to the same task (to the same

is determined by the affinity of its root activity.

<p>
The affinity determines two things &mdash; the task that the activity is re-parented
to (see the <code><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched

</p>

<p>
By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity.  You
can set this attribute to group them differently, and even place
activities defined in different applications within the same task.  To
specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set
it to an empty string.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the affinity set

   <td>The activity's main window is not resized to make room for the soft
       keyboard.  Rather, the contents of the window are automatically
       panned so that the current focus is never obscured by the keyboard
       and users can always see what they are typing.  This is generally less
       desirable than resizing, because the user may need to close the soft
       keyboard to get at and interact with obscured parts of the window.</td>
