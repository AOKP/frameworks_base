<p>
  Requests that your app makes to the network are a major cause of battery drain because they turn
  on the power-hungry mobile or Wi-Fi radios. Beyond the power needed to send and receive packets,
  these radios expend extra power just turning on and keeping awake. Something as simple as a
  network request every 15 seconds can keep the mobile radio on continuously and quickly use up
  battery power.

<p>
  This lesson shows you how to tag your app's source code to categorize, visualize and color
  your network requests according to how they are initiated. From there, each category
  identifies areas of your app that you can make more battery-efficient.
