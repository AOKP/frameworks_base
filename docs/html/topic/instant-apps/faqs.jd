<p>
  <strong>What devices are compatible with Android Instant Apps?</strong>
  <br/>
  Android Instant Apps is compatible with devices that are running Android 4.1
  (API level 16) or higher and have Google Play services installed.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Do developers need to build two different Android apps now?</strong>
  <br/>
  Developers only need to maintain one project with one source tree.
  Developers simply configure the project to create two build artifacts: the
  installable APK and the instant version.
  Some developers can take less than a day to get up and running,
  though the effort involved varies depending on how the
  app is structured.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What Android APIs and functionality can Instant Apps use?</strong>
  <br/>
  Android Instant Apps functionality complements an existing Android app,
  but does not replace it. Android Instant Apps uses the same Android APIs, the
  same project, the same source code. Android Instant Apps restricts some
  features that might not match users' expectations of an app
  that is not installed.
  For example, an Instant App can't use background services, do background
  notifications, or access unique device identifiers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Can users choose to install the app permanently?</strong>
  <br/>
  Developers can allow users to download the app from the Google Play
  Store. After download, the app remains on the phone after the user has left
  the experience.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do permissions work in Android Instant Apps?</strong>
  <br/>
  Android Instant Apps uses the runtime permissions model introduced in
  Android 6.0 (API level 23).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do developers publish these apps?</strong>
  <br/>
  Developers publish their Instant Apps through the Google Play Developer
  Console, similar to their existing Android apps.
</p>
