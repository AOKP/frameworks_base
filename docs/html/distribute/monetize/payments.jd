  Direct carrier billing
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Users pay by charging their monthly carrier bills. The benefit of direct
  carrier billing is that it opens up markets where credit cards are less
  common, as purchases are charged to your customers' monthly mobile phone
  bills. This option is available to users in key markets
  around the world. Many more will get the option in the months ahead.

</div>

<p>
  Users can pay using any credit card that they've registered in Google Play.
  The credit cards that a user adds to Google Play are stored in the user's Google wallet.
  They are available for in-app purchases and instant buys. It's easy for
  users to get started, as the initial device setup process allows users to register a credit
  card that they can use in Google Play.
