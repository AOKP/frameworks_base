<p>Let the user choose <em>your app</em> to handle specific tasks from another app,
such as sharing a picture, sending a message, or playing music. You can do this though
Android's open Intents system. By adding Intent filters for the tasks your app can handle,
you make it easy for the user to access your app’s features from other apps and from voice
commands in Google Now.</p>

<p>By declaring Intent Filters in your app, it informs the Android OS about the
actions it can perform for other apps. And in addition to making it easy for
your users to make full use of your app’s features, it can help them discover
features they didn’t know it supported.</p>

<h2 id=tips>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Identify and package any features your app can offer to other apps.
  <li> Use the "view" intent to give users the option to open any links to your
website within your app instead.
  <li> Familiarize yourself with actions commonly accomplished with intents, such as
sharing, so that you can focus on your app's core functionality and outsource
common actions.
</ul>
