<p>
  Link your Google Play Developer Console with Google Analytics to learn much
  more about how users interact with your app &mdash; before and after they
  download it.
</p>

<p>
  Start by discovering how many people visit your Google Play listing page,
  where they come from, and how many go on to install your app. Once the app is
  launched, use Google Analytics to see which of your features are most
  popular, where power users spend their time, who tends to make in-app
  purchases, and more.
</p>

<p>
  Google Analytics delivers the numbers in real time, so you can act fast to
  update your landing page and your app. <a href=

  If you have a Google Analytics account already, linking it to Google Play
  takes just a few moments. You can also link your Google Analytics account to
  Admob to start gaining more user insights to improve your in-app marketing.
