<p>Create experiences that seem magical for users who are in close proximity by using the unique
close-range and cross-platform capabilities of Nearby. Set up multiplayer games, ad-hoc groups,
sharing, or collaborative sessions so that your users can work or play together more easily when
they're close.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Nearby uses Bluetooth 2.0, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, and an
ultrasonic modem to function over distances of up to 100 feet.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>

<p>The following list contains some helpful tips and best practices that will help you set up
and use Nearby effectively:

<ul>
  <li>Use Nearby features sparingly and only when they're needed because they can consume battery
  life quickly (up to 3.5 times faster than normal).
  </li>

  <li>Invoke Nearby explicitly with a button, switch, or special screen, and provide a visual
  indication when the features are actively sending or receiving content.
  </li>

  <li>Ensure that users are aware of the data that is made visible by Nearby before
  they start using the features.
  </li>

  <li>Stop any publish or subscribe operations when the user exits the app or stops the
  activity that requires Nearby.
  </li>

  <li>Use the <em>earshot</em> option, which uses only the ultrasonic modem to send and receive
  messages, to limit the range of Nearby messages to about five feet when privacy is important.
  </li>

  <li>Accelerate the exchange of messages (when appropriate) by making one device the publisher
  only, and all other devices subscribers.
  </li>
</ul>
