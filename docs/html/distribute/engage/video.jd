<p>
  Videos are one of the most effective ways to get users excited about your
  apps. Use videos to showcase your apps on your Google Play Product Details
  pages. Be sure to build a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/dev/">YouTube</a>
  page to host new videos so users can see new features or content that will
  get them excited to return to your apps.
</p>

<p>
  Videos let you do more than tell users about your apps &mdash; you can
  <em>show them</em>. One of the most viewed content types is how-to videos.
  Help users progress to the next level with YouTube <strong>game play
  videos</strong> in Google Play, on your YouTube channel, and on your website.
