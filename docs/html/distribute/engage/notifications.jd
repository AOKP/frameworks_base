<p>
  The <a href="https://material.google.com/patterns/notifications.html">notification system</a>
  allows your app to keep the user informed about events, such as new messages,
  upcoming calendar appointments, shared photos, and much more. They are a
  fundamental feature of Android that consumers check frequently to receive
  important notifications and status updates. Notifications are like a news
  channel that alerts the user to events as they happen and maintains a list of
  updates since last review.
</p>



<p>
  In addition to status updates from friends and family, notifications can also
  be used to help gamers know when a time-based action is completed or another
  player took their turn.</p>

  <p>Some game developers use notifications to alert users
  when a new limited time character can be won or a discount on an in-app
  purchase is available. </p>

<h3>But Use Them Sparingly</h3>

<p>
  Frequent notifications and spam notifications can turn users off, thereby
  risking your ratings and user base. Also sure to check our <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/4430948">policies</a>
  to ensure youâ€™re treating your user respectfully.
</p>


          <p><strong>Tip:</strong>
       Use notifications sparingly &mdash; be sure any information presented is
      useful. Give users the option to turn notifications off.
