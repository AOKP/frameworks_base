<p>
  Users who have your app installed might overlook it as a way to get the answers
  they need. With App Indexing, deep links to your Android app appear in Google Search
  results so users can get to your native mobile experience quickly, landing exactly
  on the right content within the app.
</p>

<p>
  Google Search for developers can also help you re-engage your users in other ways
  &mdash; by letting them interact with your app from a voice action, get deep into
  your app from a search suggestion, or go back to your email reminders in Google Now. </p>


<p>Get started by <a href="https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/">indexing your
app</a> and then take advantage of <a
href="https://developers.google.com/voice-actions/">Voice actions</a>, the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/webmasters/appindexingapi">App
Indexing API</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/schemas/now/cards">Google
Now cards</a>.</p>
