<p>
With Google Cast you make it easy for users to include your content as part of
their viewing on TV and listening on audio systems. All they need is a TV with a
Chromecast plugged in, an Android TV or a Cast for audio device connected to their
audio system.</p>

<p>Cast Remote Display lets you cast a second display directly to the TV while running
a primary display on the sender. Native games can provide real-time interaction on
the TV and user control on the hand-held device. Graphics-intensive apps can now
take full advantage of multiscreen experiences via Cast.

  consumption apps, and extend their engagement with your users.

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cast devices can be low-power devices with memory, CPU, and GPU limitations,
  so the receiver application should be as lightweight as possible.</li>
  <li>User interaction should only take place on the Cast sender (phone, tablet,
  or Chrome browser), not the Cast receiver.</li>
  <li>While content is loading, provide animated loading indicators and use transitions
  to help make things feel faster on the Cast sender interface.</li>
  <li>Let users know your app is “Google Card-enabled” in your store listing and use
  the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ux_guidelines#brand-guidelines">Google
  Cast badge</a> on your website and marketing materials.</li>
</ul>
