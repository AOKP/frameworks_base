    Do I need to provide an up-to-date privacy policy and where do I do that?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Yes, you need to provide a link to a persistent privacy policy on your
    app’s store listing and confirm your compliance with local privacy statutes
    in the Developer Console. To add or review your privacy policy, choose your
    app in the Developer Console and then scroll to the bottom of the
    <strong>Store Listing</strong> section.

    If I distribute my apps globally, do I need to provide a translated version
    of my privacy policy for each separate language APK?
  </dt>
  <dd>

    distribute your apps in a few select countries, it is advised that you do
    translate your privacy policy.

<dl>
  <dt>
    Will it take longer for my app to get published if I opt-in to the Designed
    for Families program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    When you opt-in to Designed for Families, Google Play reviews your app to
    confirm that it is appropriate for families. Assuming your app complies with all program
    requirements, we expect that publishing time should not take any longer
    than normal; however, there may be a delay in publishing the app if it is
    rejected during the Designed for Families review.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens if my app is rejected from the Designed for Families program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    If your app is rejected from the Designed for Families program, we’ll
    indicate why in the Developer Console and in a detailed email. You’ll have
    an opportunity to correct the issues and resubmit your app to the program,
    or change your opt-in response. Note that if you have an existing app that
    is live on Google Play, only your app update will be rejected (your app
    will remain live on the Play store). If you’ve submitted a new app to the
    Designed for Families program that does not meet the requirements, your
    entire app submission will be rejected and the app will not be published on
    Play. You can then address the identified issue(s) and resubmit the app for
    the Designed for Families program or opt-out of the program.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens if my app is found to be non-compliant with Designed for
    Families program requirements after it has been published?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Your app may be removed or suspended from the Google Play Store, not only
    the Designed for Families program. Removed apps can follow the same
    remedies as rejected apps. Suspended apps can be appealed using the
    developer appeal process.

  <dt>
    If I opt-in to the Designed for Families program, can I opt-out later on?
  </dt>

    out you would lose your placement in the new family-friendly experience as
    well as the other benefits of the program.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens when I update my app after it has been accepted into the
    program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Apps that are part of the Designed for Families program need to maintain
    compliance with the eligibility requirements at all times. If you need to
    edit the Designed for Families metadata associated with your app, please go
    to the Pricing & Distribution section of the Google Play Developer Console
    to edit this information. If updating your app results in you changing your
    target audience, we recommend that you alert the users who already
    have your app installed.
  </dd>

    Can apps and games that use Google sign-in or Google Play Game
    services opt-into the Designed for Families program?
  </dt>

    Apps that participate in Designed for Families that are wholly
    child-focused, i.e. that target the following age groups: Ages 5 & Under,
    Ages 6 to 8, or Ages 9 to 12 <strong>may not</strong> use Google+ Sign-in
    or Google Play Game services as the login experience for their
    application.

    <p>
      Apps that participate in Designed for Families that target both children and
      older audiences, can use Google+ Sign-in or Google Play Game services as an

    Apps that participate in Google Play for Education may use Google sign-in for
    student accounts as long as it is not a blocking requirement for all users of the app.

    Play reserves the right to reject apps for overly aggressive commercial
    tactics. Google Play will enforce IAP password protection on all apps
