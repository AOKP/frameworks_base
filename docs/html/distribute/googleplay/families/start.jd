<p>
  If you're building an app designed for kids and families, there are a few
  things you need to do <em>before</em> you’ll be ready to opt-in to the Designed for
  Families program:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the content rating questionnaire for your app and meet an ESRB
  rating of Everyone or Everyone 10+ rating
  </li>

  <li>Add a privacy policy link to your app’s <strong>Store Listing</strong>
  page.
  </li>

  <li>Make sure your app meets all the <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6184502">Designed
  for Families program requirements.</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now that your app is ready to publish, you can opt-in to Designed for
  Families directly from the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Developer Console</a>. Opt-in means
  that you want your app to be made available on the family-friendly
  experience on Google Play in addition to the category you’ve selected on
  the Google Play Store.
</p>

<p>
  Opt-in also confirms that your app complies with <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">Google Play
  Developer Program Policies</a> and the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html">Developer
  Distribution Agreement</a>, including the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/families/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html">
  Designed for Families DDA Addendum</a>. If you are not familiar with these
  policy documents or the Addendum, make sure to read them before opting-in.
</p>

<p>
  Once you're ready, here's how to opt-in to Designed for Families for a specific app:
</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Developer Console <strong>All Applications</strong> page, click the app you want to
  opt-in. Under Pricing and Distribution, scroll down to find <strong>Designed for
  Families</strong> and the opt-in checkbox.<img src="/images/gp-dff-optin.png" style=
  "border:2px solid #ddd;margin:1em 0;">
  </li>

  <li>Start the opt-in flow and confirm that your app meets the eligibility
  requirements.</li>
  <li>If your app has ads, confirm that it meets the ads policy.
  <img src="/images/gp-dff-appinfo.png"
  style="border:2px solid #ddd;margin:1em 0;"></li>
  <li>Choose your target age groups from: Ages 5 & Under, Ages 6 to 8, Ages 9
  to 12, or General Audience (for apps which target children and older
  audiences). You can choose up to two adjacent age groups only if your app
  targets more than one age group. Apps with an ESRB 10+ rating can only choose an
  age target of 9-12 or General Audience. <!--Apps that are found to be inappropriate
  for the age groups selected will -->
  </li>

  <li>Choose a category for your app for the new family-focused experience on
  Google Play. Your app will also be discoverable in its existing category in
  Google Play.</li>
  <li>Review and agree to the linked documents and then click
  <strong>Opt-In</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Submit update</strong> on the
  Pricing & Distribution page to publish or update your app.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Once you opt-in your app, it will be thoroughly reviewed before being
  accepted into the Designed for Families program.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: Published apps in the Designed for Families program
  are also available to all users on Google Play.
</p>

<p>
  If you opt-in an app that you're publishing for the first time and it doesn't
  meet the Designed for Families program requirements, it won't be made available
  on Google Play until <strong>either</strong> you update the app to meet the
  program requirements <strong>or</strong> you uncheck the opt-in box and pass
  Google Play's standard review process.
</p>

<p>
  If you opt-in an app that's already published on Google Play and it doesn't
  meet the program requirements, it will remain available to all users but won't
  be added to the family experience until you update the app to meet the
  program requirements.
</p>

<p>
  If you publish an update to an app that's opted-in to Designed for Families,
  the app update needs to pass the Designed for Families review before it will
  become available to all users on Google Play.</p>
