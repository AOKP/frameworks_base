<p>Users have a huge amount of choice when it comes to which apps they install and
use, so it’s important to actively find new ways to promote your app and drive
ongoing engagement. AdWords campaigns, which you create in the
<a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Google Play Developer Console</a>,
are a powerful and effective way to do both.</p>


<h2 id="drive_installs">Drive installs with universal app campaigns</h2>

<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com">AdWords</a> is a powerful way to scale
app promotion across Google networks and find customers who are most likely to
install your app. AdWords promotes your app to interested users where they spend
time on phones and tablets – with app install ads on Google Play, Google Search,
YouTube, Gmail, and within apps and across the web.</p>

<p>By creating a <em>universal app camapign</em>, you can reach all of these
networks. This type of campaign allocates ads, bids, and budgets automatically,
making it easier to improve install volume for your app.</p>

  work out an appropriate cost-per-install that you’re willing to pay.
  </li>

  describe your app’s value.
  </li>

  <li>Check that you’re accurately tracking and attributing installs by
  installing the AdWords <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/">conversion tracking
  SDK</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Promote your app broadly across display, search, and video to reach even
  more potential users and drive a higher volume of installs.
  </li>

  <li>Start with broader targeting and then fine tune your bidding once you’ve
  assessed your campaign results.
  </li>

  <li>Use Conversion Optimizer to automate your bidding so that your ads target
  users who are most likely to install your app.
  </li>
