  <a class="external-link" href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6615809648420562690">Tapps</a> is
  a mobile game publisher in São Paulo, Brazil. With a mission of <em>creating
  fun for everyone</em>, Tapps has a portfolio of over 200 titles on the Google
  Play Store, with roughly 70% of their installs coming from Android. Store
  listing experiments have provided invaluable metrics to help their growing
  team understand what makes the most effective product listings.
</p>

<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  Tapps has increased their use of store listing experiments in the Developer
  Console. They recently expanded their marketing team to allocate greater time
  and designated resources to the Developer Console tools. <strong>"We can’t
  stress enough how much value the store listing experiments have brought us
  over the past months. Right now, our marketing team has a substantial time
  allocated to these tests every week,"</strong> said Felipe Watanabe, head of
  marketing at Tapps. With icons and screenshots, Tapps tested variations in
  color, character positioning, and the overall amount of graphic detail. In
  the description tests, they found that shorter messages with clear calls to
  action and appropriate language localizations were most successful.
</p>

<h3>
  Results
</h3>

<p>
  By frequently conducting store listing experiments, Tapps gained valuable
  insights that they have applied across their greater portfolio of games.
  Results showed that shortening messaging, using contrasting colors,
  reordering screenshots, and simplifying graphics often led to variant results
  representing an average increase in performance between 5% and 50%. After
  making changes based on the test results, Tapps saw <strong>install rates
  increase beyond 20-30%</strong>.
