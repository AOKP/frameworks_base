<h3>
  Background
</h3>

<p>
  <a class="external-link" href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gi.elmundo.main">El
  Mundo</a>, one of Spain’s largest newspapers, integrated material design
  principles into their app, which helped increase their Google Play Store
  rating and improve user engagement.
</p>

<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  El Mundo decided to completely redesign their app to provide a higher quality
  user experience, making it easier for their readers to engage with news
  content. By implementing material design guidelines, they created a
  consistent look and feel throughout their app.
</p>

<p>
  After analyzing user comments, El Mundo discovered that readers considered
  their app to be complicated and out-of-date. Therefore, they decided to
  simplify the app’s functionality by removing features that were redundant.
  They also removed sections of their app that were less relevant to their
  readers, such as weather updates and movie trailers. Finally, they applied a
  brand new internal development framework that they now use consistently
  across all of their apps.
</p>

<h3>
  Results
</h3>

<p>
  Following the re-launch of their material design app, El Mundo saw a
  <strong>45% increase in the weekly install rate</strong>. Readers now spend
  more time in the app, with the average time spent in-app increasing from one
  to three minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, this redesign resulted in more readers providing positive
  feedback around the new experience, increasing the app rating in the Google
  Play store by 25.8%, from 3.1 to 3.9.
