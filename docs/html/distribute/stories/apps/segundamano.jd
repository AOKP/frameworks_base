  is a leading shopping application in Mexico for second-hand products. They
  started by placing classified ads in newspapers, progressed to desktop, and
  over the past year have seen significant growth in mobile, which now accounts
  for 70% of their business. They have also seen <strong>270% year-over-year
  growth on the Android platform alone</strong>.
</p>

<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  Segundamano shifted focus to mobile with their Android app because of the
  high potential for growth. From July 2015 to January 2016, they saw an
  increase of 55% in the number of classified ads on Android, higher than any
  other platform. To leverage this momentum, Segundamano implemented two new
  features on Android: premium offers and push notifications. Segundamano also
  decided to implement material design in order to improve the in-app
  experience and streamline the sales process for users.

<h3>
  Results

  Following Segundamanoâ€™s enhancements to the user experience, they've seen an
  increase in their star rating, a 4.7% lift in monthly active users, and a 7%
  increase in sales of premium listings. Additionally, year-to-date, their
  <strong>installs are over seven times higher on Android than on other
  platforms</strong>.
