<h3>
  Background
</h3>

<p>
  Aftenposten is one of the largest newspapers in Norway. Their <a class=
  "external-link" href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.cita&amp;e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign">
  news app</a> was released on Android in 2013.
</p>

<p>
  Aftenposten found that sending too many notifications, with no user control
  over the default <em>on</em> setting or differentiation between general and
  breaking news, caused many people to uninstall their app. They changed the
  user controls for notifications and used the native Android share button in
  the app, <strong>which reduced user uninstalls</strong>.
</p>

<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  Aftenposten created a new onboarding flow that explained what notifications
  were available, allowing readers to manage their preferences and customize up
  to three topics. They also changed their custom share icon for the native
  Android app.
</p>

<h3>
  Results
</h3>

<p>
  The results showed that with the new notifications management onboarding
  screen, <strong>uninstalls decreased by 9.2% over 60 days</strong>. And with
  the option to customize notifications, 51% of readers decided to keep two out
  of three topics turned on. This led to a <strong>28% decrease over 60 days in
  the number of users muting notifications completely</strong>. It also
  provided insight into usersâ€™ content preferences, with <em>Sport</em> being
  the least-favored notification.
</p>

<p>
  Aftenposten also increased share interactions by 17% just by replacing their
  custom share icon with the native Android share icon.
</p>

<p>
  Aftenposten commented that: <em>Many of our users who see the onboarding
  screen interact with it by turning off at least one notification topic. This
  means that users are accepting push from one or more topics, instead of
  turning it off completely. Moreover, readers are sharing more articles since
  we added the standard share Android icon.</em>
