<p>
  Google Analytics integrates seamlessly with a wide range of Google products.
  You’ll find your Google Analytics data available to you in the Google Play
  Developer Console, AdMob, AdWords, Google Tag Manager, and more. This makes
  your Analytics data even more valuable, as it's available where you make
  decisions in the Google products you use the most.
</p>
<p class="caution">
  <strong>Tip</strong>: Make sure to link your Google Analytics account with
  your Google Play developer account. This lets you set up an Analytics
  property for each of your apps to track usage and behavior in the apps, all
  in one place. For details on how to link your see <a href=

<h2 id="remarket">Target and Remarket to Your Users in AdWords</h2>

<p>
  Google Analytics has one of the easiest to use yet most sophisticated
  segmentation tools. You can slice and dice your data in tens-of-thousands of
  different ways, by specifying the criteria you want to zoom-in on. Using
  these segments you can create Audience Lists of app users to remarket to.
  Perhaps you notice that certain users haven’t come back in 2 weeks, and you’d
  like to reach out to remind them to return. Creating lists with this sort of
  sophistication is easier than ever using Google Analytics. You can even
  create lists directly from your reports when you find a segment that is
  particularly interesting.

<h2 id="strategies">No More One-Size-Fits-All Monetization Strategies</h2>

<p>
  Users are different, so why force them all to have the same experience? Using
  Audience Lists, you can serve users experiences that are best tuned to their
  usage patterns. In AdMob, for example, you can select a group of high value
  users, those who have made purchases, and serve them IAP ads and experiences;
  however, for users that are less likely to make purchases you can serve them
  ads instead. Pairing the right users with the right experiences is a key part
  of a modern, targeted monetization strategy. And Google Analytics’ countless
  segmentation possibilities means unlimited monetization opportunities.

<p>
  See your data in context. Google Analytics is available inside AdMob without
  leaving the page; with this integration, you can now slice and dice your data
  in the same place that you Monetize your app. Using Analytics in AdMob, you
  can identify interesting segments and then create Audience lists based on
  those criteria. You can then target AdMob monetization strategies to those
  different user groups, to serve them the best experiences.

<p>
  By linking your Analytics account to the Google Play Developer Console, you
  can see your in-app data in the context of the Play Store. This allows you to
  see any differences in usage patterns by variables such as region, device,
  time, day, and more.

<h2 id="optimize">Optimize Your App to Reach Your Objectives</h2>

<p>
  By using Content Experiments in Google Tag Manager, you can run A/B tests on
  app elements. Are your social sharing buttons better at the top or bottom? Is
  algorithm X or algorithm Y better for cross-selling products in your app?
  With Content Experiments you can gather data from user to guide your
  optimizations and take the guesswork out of the equation.
