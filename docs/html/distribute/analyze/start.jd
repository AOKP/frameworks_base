  Getting started with Google Analytics is easy. You can usually start
  measuring your app's use by writing one line of code — or less! Google
  Analytics is designed around the way you work, with flexible implementation
  options to fit your needs. Take a look at these options and choose the right
  one for you.

<p>
  If you’re a Google Play developer, it’s likely you’re already using the
  Google Play Services SDK. If you are, unlocking the power of Google Analytics
  is only a line of code away. Here's how:

<h2 id="unityplugin">Unity Plugin</h2>

<p>
  If you’re a developer who uses an app engine to build games for multiple
  platforms, consider using the Google Analytics Unity Plugin. With the Unity
  Plugin, you add Google Analytics to your app as an in-line part of your
  development process. When you compile your app for a given platform, the
  appropriate Google Analytics SDK is added automatically &mdash; giving you
  Google Analytics across Android, iOS, and other platforms with a single
  implementation.

<h2 id="tagmanager">Google Tag Manager</h2>

<p>
  Looking for a way to update and improve your in-app analytics without having
  to release a new version of your app waiting for your users to update? Then
  Google Tag Manager is the solution for you. With Tag Manager for Apps, you
  instrument your app once and then use the simple web interface to customize
  your Google Analytics implementation. Updates you make using Tag Manager get
  pushed to the installed instances of your app on user devices &mdash; so there's no
  need for you to release an app update!
</p>

<p>
  Google Tag Manager can also be used to control in-app configurations and to
  power <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/analyze/build-better-apps.html#test">A/B
  testing</a>. And since Tag Manager is a part of the Google Play Services SDK,
  there’s no additional resources you need to keep track of.
