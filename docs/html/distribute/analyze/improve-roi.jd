  You want to get your apps in the hands of as many interested people as
  possible and there are many ways of doing that. Whatever channels you use,
  measuring their effectiveness is essential. You want to know that they're
  not just driving installs, but acquiring users who are likely to engage or
  convert over time &mdash; and that it's being done cost efficiently.
</p>

<h2 id="campaignattribution">Multi-Network Campaign Attribution</h2>

<p>
  Advertising campaigns are being used increasingly to drive new users to
  download your app using different ad networks, formats, and payment methods.
  A good campaign will bring not only downloads, but also users who are highly
  engaged. If you want to get more visibility into which campaigns are driving
  the highest value, measuring cost per download is only a partial view.
</p>

<p>
  Combine the power of Google Analytics with other data you have to get an
  unbiased view of the performance of each network: from cost per download to
  ROI analysis for each of your marketing channels. You can tailor
  your acquisition strategies and maximize in-app revenue. Here is an example
  of how to approach this type of analysis:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Network</th>
<th>Cost per Install (from Networks)</th>
<th>30 day Revenue per user</th>
<th># of downloads</th>
<th>Total budget spent</th>
<th>Total Revenue</th>
<th>Profit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alpha</td>
<td>$0.80</td>
<td>$0.95</td>
<td>3,500</td>
<td>$2,800.00</td>
<td>$3,325.00</td>
<td>$525.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta</td>
<td>$2.10</td>
<td>$2.15</td>
<td>2,500</td>
<td>$5,250.00</td>
<td>$5,375.00</td>
<td>$125.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma</td>
<td>$5.00</td>
<td>$6.20</td>
<td>700</td>
<td>$3,500.00</td>
<td>$4,340.00</td>
<td>$840.00</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
  When analyzing networks’ performance, it's important to take into
  consideration more than just the cost per install. In the example, all the
  networks are providing positive ROI, as the positive profit illustrates;
  however, each channel has different strengths depending on the business
  objective:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network Alpha is very efficient in driving high download volumes, but
  users are not spending as much as users from the other networks
  </li>

  <li>Network Beta is driving more revenue than any other network, but the net
  profit is not as high
  </li>

  <li>Network Gamma has a strong profit, but it is not delivering similar
  download volumes
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Depending on your business objectives you can approach acquisition marketing
  in a variety of ways; for the best analytical approach capture a holistic
  picture in order to optimize your campaigns &mdash; factoring engagement and
  monetization data in with download statistics.
</p>

<h2 id="installs">Install and Post-Download Conversions</h2>

<p>
  Installs &mdash; or first launches &mdash; are a key type of conversion, but
  it’s important to keep in mind that successful apps have users that return
  regularly. Google Analytics has reports to measure post-download user
  activities such as how often they come back, how much time they spend in the
  app, and how much they spend. This can be sliced by acquisition channel to
  understand which has the most impact.
</p>

<h2 id="campaigntracking">Campaign Tracking</h2>

<p>
  You can use a wide range of networks to drive installs of your apps. With
  Google Analytics you can easily report campaign data from many networks. Once
  you setup your URLs to pass the correct parameters, you'll see network
  sources associated with in-app behavioral metrics. As a result, Google
  Analytics provides a holistic view of your campaign performance from
  downloads to purchases as well as user retention.
</p>

<h2 id="camaignreports">AdWords Campaign Reporting</h2>

<p>
  By linking your AdWords account(s) to Google Analytics you unlock the ability
  to gain insights into acquisition campaigns, such as which keywords or ad
  creative works best. These automatic reports show exactly how your search and
  display campaigns are performing and offer rich insights into the kind of
  users you’re driving to download your app.

<h2 id="flow">Google Play Referral Flow</h2>

<p>
  When you link your Analytics account to the Play Developer Console you'll
  start seeing Google Play data automatically flowing into your account.
  Without having to implement any additional code, you'll see traffic sources
  for your Play listing page in addition to installs. Some of Google Analytics
  active user reporting is available in the Play Developer Console as well.
