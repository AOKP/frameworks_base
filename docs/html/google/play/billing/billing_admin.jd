<p>In-app billing frees you from processing financial transactions, but you still need to perform a
few administrative tasks. These tasks include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up and maintaining your product list on the Google Play Developer Console.</li>
  <li>Registering test accounts.</li>
  <li>Handling refunds when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To register a test account, you must have a Google Play publisher account. If you
already have a publisher account on Google Play, you can use your existing account. You do not
need to register for a new account to support in-app billing. If you don't have a publisher
account, you can register as a Google Play developer and set up a publisher account through the <a
href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Google Play Developer Console</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to create a product list and issue refunds to your users, you must have a
Google payments merchant account. If you don't have a merchant account, you can
register for one through the Developer Console.</p>

<h2 id="billing-list-setup">Creating a Product List</h2>

<p>The Google Play Developer Console provides a product list for each of your published
apps. You can sell an item using Google Play's in-app billing feature only if the item is
listed on an app's product list. Each app has its own product list; you cannot sell
items that appear on another app's product list.</p>

<p>You can access an app's product list by opening the <strong>In-app Products</strong>
page for an app that is listed in your developer account. The link to the
<strong>In-app Products</strong> page appears only if you have a Google payments merchant
account and the app's manifest includes the
<code>com.android.vending.BILLING</code> permission. For more information about this
permission, see <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html#billing-permission">
Updating Your App's Manifest</a>.</p>

<p>A product list specifies items you are selling in an app: in-app products,
subscriptions, or a combination of both. For each item, the product list contains information
such as product ID, product description, and price. You can create a product list for any
published app, including apps published to the alpha and beta channels.</p>

<p>The product list stores only metadata about the items you are selling in your app.
It does not store any digital content. You are responsible for storing and delivering
the digital content that you sell in your apps.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Previously, you could test an app by
uploading an unpublished draft version. This functionality is no longer
supported; instead, you must publish it to the alpha or beta distribution
channel. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#draft_apps">Draft Apps
are No Longer Supported</a>.

<p>In addition, an app package can have only one product list. If you create a product
list for an app, and you use the <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html">multiple APK feature</a> to distribute
more than one APK for that app, the product list applies to all APK versions that are
associated with the app listing. You cannot create individual product lists for each APK if
you are using the multiple APK feature.</p>

<p>You can add items to a product list two ways: you can add items one at a time on the <strong>In-app
Products</strong> page, or you can add a batch of items by importing the items from a
comma-separated values (CSV) file. Adding items one at a time is useful if your
app has only a few in-app items or you are adding only a few items to a
product list for testing purposes. The CSV file method is useful if your app has a large
number of in-app items.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Batch upload of product lists containing
  subscriptions is not supported. Also, when updating existing items in a batch upload,
  you cannot include changes to in-app products that are linked to a
<a href="#pricing-template">pricing template</a>.</p>

<h3 id="billing-form-add">Adding items one at a time to a product list</h3>

<p>To add an item to a product list using the Developer Console UI, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher account.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>All applications</strong> panel, click on the
  app name, then open the <strong>In-app Products</strong> page.</li>
  <li><p>Click <strong>Add new product</strong>. After you provide the product type and ID for the item you are
  selling, click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
  <dl>
      <dt>Product Type</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The product type can be <strong>Managed product</strong> or <strong>Subscription</strong>. You cannot
        change an item's product type after you create the item. For more information, see
        <a href="#billing-purchase-type">Choosing a Product Type</a>.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>For subscription items, you cannot change the
        item's price once you have published the item.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Product ID</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Product IDs are unique across an app's namespace. A product ID must start with a
        lowercase letter or a number and must be composed of only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers
        (0-9), underscores (_), and periods (.). The product ID <code>android.test</code> is reserved, as are all
        product IDs that start with <code>android.test</code>.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Be sure to plan your product ID namespace carefully. You
        cannot modify an item's product ID after the item is created, and you cannot reuse
        a product ID within an app.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li><p>Enter additional information about the item, then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Publishing State</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>An item's publishing state can be <strong>Active</strong> or
        <strong>Inactive</strong>. To be visible to a user during checkout, an item's publishing state must be set to
        <strong>Active</strong>, and the item's app must be published on Google Play.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using a test account, users can see active items
        within unpublished apps, as well. For more information, see <a
        href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#billing-testing-real">Testing In-app
        Billing</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Languages and Translations</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>By default, in-app products inherit their default language from the parent app.</p>
        <p>You can provide localized titles and descriptions for your in-app
        products by selecting <strong>Add Translations</strong>. If you want Google
        Play to translate your title and description for you, based on the title and
        description in the default language, just choose the languages that you
        want to offer. You can also provide custom translations in specific
        languages.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Title</dt>
      <dd>
        The title is a short descriptor for the item. An example of a title is: "Sleeping potion."
        Every item must have a title. The title is visible to users during checkout. For optimum appearance,
        titles should be no longer than 25 characters; however, titles can be up to 55 characters in length.
      </dd>
      <dt>Description</dt>
      <dd>
        The description is a long descriptor for the item. An example of a description is:
        "Instantly puts creatures to sleep. Does not work on angry elves." Every item must have a description.
        Descriptions can be up to 80 characters in length.
      </dd>
      <dt>Price</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Provide a price in your home currency, or link the price to an existing
        pricing template. Based on the price you enter or the prices
        from the pricing template, the system autofills country-specific prices for
        different currencies. These generated prices use current exchange rates and
        locally relevant pricing patterns (see figure 1).</p>
        <p>You can also change prices for other currencies manually, but you can do
          this only if a currency is used in one of the target countries for your
          app. You can specify target countries for your app on the
          <strong>Pricing &amp; Distribution</strong> page in the Google Play
          Developer Console.</p>

<h3 id="billing-bulk-add">Adding a batch of items to a product list</h3>

<p>To add a batch of items to a product list using a CSV file, you first need to create your CSV
file. The data values that you specify in the CSV file represent the same data values you specify
manually through the In-app Products UI (see <a href="#billing-form-add">Adding items one at a time
to a product list</a>).

<p>If you are importing and exporting CSV files with in-app products, keep
country-specific pricing in mind. If you use auto-fill, you can provide a
tax-exclusive default price, and tax-inclusive prices will be auto-filled. If you
do not use auto-fill, prices you provide must include tax.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Batch upload of product lists containing
subscriptions is not supported. Also, when updating existing items in a batch
upload, you cannot include changes to in-app products that are linked to a
<a href="#pricing-template">pricing template</a>.</p>

<p>To import the items that are specified in your CSV file, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher account.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>All applications</strong> panel, select the app
  name, then open the <strong>In-app Products</strong> page.</li>
  <li>On the In-app Products List page, click <strong>Import/Export</strong>
  &gt; <strong>Import in-app products from CSV file</strong>, then select your
  CSV file.
    <p>The CSV file must be on your local computer or on a local disk that is connected to your
    computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Overwrite</strong> checkbox if you want to overwrite existing items in
  your product list.
    <p>This option overwrites values of existing items only if the value of the <em>product_id</em>
    in the CSV file matches the In-app Product ID for an existing item in the product list.
    Overwriting doesn't delete items that are on a product list but not present in the CSV
    file.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can also export an existing product list to a CSV file by clicking <strong>Export to CSV
</strong> on the In-app Product List page. This is useful if you have manually added items to
a product list and you want to start managing the product list through a CSV file.</p>

<h4 id="billing-bulk-format">Formatting batches of items</h4>

<p>The CSV file uses commas (,) and semicolons (;) to separate data values.
Commas are used to separate primary data values, and semicolons are used to
separate subvalues. For example, the syntax for the CSV file is as follows:</p>

<p>"<em>product_id</em>","<em>publish_state</em>","<em>purchase_type</em>","<em>autotranslate</em>
","<em>locale</em>; <em>title</em>; <em>description</em>","<em>autofill</em>","<em>country</em>;
<em>price</em>"
</p>

<p>Descriptions and usage details are provided below.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>product_id</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the In-app Product ID setting in the In-app Products UI. If you specify
    a <em>product_id</em> that already exists in a product list, and you choose to overwrite
    the product list while importing the CSV file, the data for the existing item is overwritten with
    the values specified in the CSV file. The overwrite feature does not delete items that are on a
    product list but not present in the CSV file.
  </dd>
  <dt>publish_state</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the Publishing State setting in the In-app Products UI. Can be <code>
    published</code> or <code>unpublished</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>purchase_type</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the Product Type setting in the In-app Products UI. Can be <code>
    managed_by_android</code>, which is equivalent to <strong>Managed per user account
    </strong> in the In-app Products UI, or <code>managed_by_publisher</code>, which is equivalent
    to <strong>Unmanaged</strong> in the In-app Products UI.
  </dd>
  <dt>autotranslate</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to selecting the <strong>Fill fields with auto translation</strong>
    checkbox in the In-app Products UI. Can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>locale</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is equivalent to the Language setting in the In-app Products UI. You must have an entry
    for the default locale. The default locale must be the first entry in the list of
    locales, and it must include a <em>title</em> and <em>description</em>. If you want to provide
    translated versions of the <em>title</em> and <em>description</em> in addition to the default,
    you must use the following syntax rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>If <em>autotranslate</em> is <code>true</code>, you must specify the default locale,
      default title, default description, and other locales using the following format:</p>
      <p>"true,"<em>default_locale</em>; <em>default_locale_title</em>;
      <em>default_locale_description</em>; <em>locale_2</em>;    <em>locale_3</em>, ..."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If <em>autotranslate</em> is <code>false</code>, you must specify the default locale,
      default title, and default description as well as the translated titles and descriptions using
      the following format:</p>
      <p>"false,"<em>default_locale</em>; <em>default_locale_title</em>;
      <em>default_locale_description</em>; <em>locale_2</em>; <em>locale_2_title</em>;
      <em>local_2_description</em>; <em>locale_3</em>; <em>locale_3_title</em>;
       <em>locale_3_description</em>; ..."</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See table 1 for a list of the language codes you can use with the <em>locale</em> field.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>title</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the Title setting in the In-app Products UI. If the <em>title</em>
    contains a semicolon, it must be escaped with a backslash (for example, <code>\;</code>). Also, a backslash
    must be escaped with a backslash (for example, <code>\\</code>).
  </dd>
  <dt>description</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the Description in the In-app Products UI. If the <em>description</em>
    contains a semicolon, it must be escaped with a backslash (for example, <code>\;</code>). Also, a backslash
    must be escaped with a backslash (for example, <code>\\</code>).
  </dd>
  <dt>autofill</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is equivalent to clicking <strong>Auto Fill</strong> in the In-app Products UI. Can be
    <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The syntax for specifying the <em>country</em>
    and <em>price</em> varies depending on which <em>autofill</em> setting you use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If <em>autofill</em> is set to <code>true</code>, you need to specify only the default
        price in your home currency, and you must use this syntax:</p>
        <p>"true","<em>default_price_in_home_currency</em>"
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If <em>autofill</em> is set to <code>false</code>, you need to specify a <em>country</em>
        and a <em>price</em> for each currency, and you must use the following syntax:</p>
        <p>"false", "<em>home_country</em>; <em>default_price_in_home_currency</em>; <em>country_2</em>;
        <em>country_2_price</em>; <em>country_3</em>; <em>country_3_price</em>; ..."</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>If you use an <em>autofill</em> value of <code>false</code>
    and set country prices manually, you must incorporate country-specific
    pricing patterns, including tax rates, into the prices you provide.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>country</dt>
  <dd>
    The country for which you are specifying a price. You can only list countries that your
    app is targeting. The country codes are two-letter uppercase
    ISO country codes (such as "US"), as defined by
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-2</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>price</dt>
  <dd>
    This is equivalent to the Price in the In-app Products UI. The price must be specified in
    micro-units. To convert a currency value to micro-units, you multiply the real value by
    1,000,000.
    For example, if you want to sell an in-app item for $1.99, you specify <code>1990000</code> in the
    <em>price</em> field.

  Pricing Templates
</h2>

<p>
  If you sell multiple apps at the same price, or if you sell multiple in-app
  products at the same price across one or more apps, you can add <em>pricing
  templates</em>. These templates make it easier to manage shared prices.
</p>

<h3 id="add-pricing-template">
  Adding a pricing template
</h3>

<p>
  When creating a pricing template, you provide new pricing information that you
  can apply to paid apps and in-app products. To add a pricing template, do the
  following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher
    account.
  </li>

  <li>In the <strong>Settings</strong> panel, open the <strong>Pricing
  template</strong> page.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      If you are adding your first pricing template, the <strong>Add a Pricing
      Template</strong> banner appears. Select <strong>Add template</strong> to
      create a new template. The new template's <em>Pricing</em> tab appears.
    </p>

    <p>
      Otherwise, you see a list of your pricing templates. Select <strong>New
      pricing template</strong>. The new template's <em>Pricing</em> tab
      appears.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Provide details about the template. These details include the name, the
      price, and whether to include tax as part of your country-specific
      prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the price and tax option you provide, the Developer Console
      generates prices for international currencies using current exchange
      rates and country-specific pricing patterns.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Select <strong>Create template</strong> to finish adding the template.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="link-pricing-template">
  Linking a pricing template
</h3>

<p>
  You can create links between pricing templates and sets of paid apps and
  in-app products that share the same price. After completing this linking
  process, any changes you make to the pricing template are applied to the
  prices of items that you've linked to the template. To complete the linking
  process, use either the pricing template's <em>Linked Items</em> tab or the
  Price section within a paid app or in-app product's pricing page.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Since a subscription within your app has a constant
  price, you cannot link a subscription with a pricing template. You can,
  however, import the prices from a pricing template and apply them to a new
  subscription.
</p>

<h4>
  Linking a pricing template to in-app products and paid apps
</h4>

<p>
  To link a pricing template to an in-app product, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher
    account.
  </li>

  <li>In the <strong>Settings</strong> panel, open the <strong>Pricing
  template</strong> page. This page shows the list of pricing templates you have
  created for your account.
  </li>

  <li>Choose an existing pricing template that you want to link to an in-app
  product, then select the template's <em>Linked Items</em> tab. This tab shows
  options to link your pricing template to in-app products and paid apps
  (see figure 2).
  </li>

  <li>In the Link In-App Products section of the tab, enter or choose the name
  of an app. This app should contain the in-app product that you want to link
  to your pricing template.
  </li>

  <li>Based on the app that you selected, you see a list of in-app products
  that are active and are not yet linked to a pricing template. Choose the
  in-app product that you want to link to the pricing template by selecting the
  <strong>Link</strong> button that appears in the same row as the in-app
  product.
  </li>

  <li>The price of the in-app product is now linked to your pricing template.
  Any changes you make to the prices within your pricing template affect the
  prices of the linked in-app product.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To link a pricing template to the price of a paid app, you follow a similar
  process. On the pricing template's <em>Linked Items</em> tab, choose a paid
  app in the Link Paid Apps section.
</p>

  <li>The price of the in-app product is now linked to the pricing template you
  selected. Any changes you make to the prices within your pricing template
  affect the prices of this in-app product.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To link the price of a paid app to a pricing template, you follow a similar
  process on the app's <strong>Pricing &amp; Distribution</strong> page.
</p>

<h3 id="delete-linked-item">
  Deleting an item that is linked to a pricing template
</h3>

<p>
  As your app evolves, you may find it useful to remove older versions of
  in-app products or unpublish paid apps, some of which may be linked to pricing
  templates. To delete an in-app product or unpublish a paid app that is linked
  to a pricing template, complete the following steps. You don't need to unlink
  the in-app product or paid app from the pricing template beforehand.
</p>

<h4>
  Deleting an in-app product that is linked to a template
</h4>

<p>
  To delete an in-app product that is linked to a template, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher
    account.
  </li>

  <li>Select the app that contains the in-app product you want to delete.
  </li>

  <li>Open the app's <strong>In-app Products</strong> page.
  </li>

  <li>Choose the in-app product that you want to delete.
  </li>

  If you no longer need a pricing template, you can delete it by completing the
  following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher
    account.
  </li>

  <li>In the <strong>Settings</strong> panel, open the <strong>Pricing
  template</strong> page, which shows the list of pricing templates you have
  created for your account.
  </li>

  <li>Select the pricing template that you wish to delete.
  </li>

  <li>On the pricing template's <em>Linked Items</em> tab, unlink all in-app
  products that are linked to the template.</li>

  <li>Select <strong>Delete template</strong>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="billing-purchase-type">Choosing a Product Type</h3>

<p>An item's product type controls how Google Play manages the purchase of the item. The supported
product types include "managed product" and "subscription." Since support for different product
types can vary among versions of the In-app Billing API, make sure that you choose a product
type that's valid for the version of the In-app Billing API that your app uses. </p>

<p>For details, refer to the documentation for the <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/api.html#producttype">In-app Billing API</a>.

<h2 id="billing-refunds">Handling Refunds</h2>

<p>In-app billing does not allow users to send a refund request to Google Play. Refunds for
in-app purchases must be directed to you (the app developer). You can then process the
refund through your Google payments merchant account. When you do this, Google Play receives a
refund notification from Google payments, and Google Play sends a refund message to your
app. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/api.html#billing-action-notify">Handling
IN_APP_NOTIFY messages</a> and <a
href="http://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1153485">
In-app Billing Pricing</a>.</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot use the API to issue
refunds or cancel In-app Billing transactions. You must do this manually through your Google
payments merchant account. However, you can use the API to retrieve order
information.</p>

<h2 id="orderId">Working with Order Numbers</h2>

<p>When a user purchases an in-app item, Google assigns the transaction
a unique and permanent order number. Google Play provides that order number to
you at the conclusion of the purchase flow, as the value of the
<code>orderId</code> field of the <code>PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED</code>
intent.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Test purchases don't have an <code>orderId</code>
  field. To track test transactions, you use the <code>purchaseToken</code>
  field instead. For more information about working with test purchases, see <a
  href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_testing.html">Testing In-app
  Billing</a>.
</p>

<p>In your app, you can use the order number as a general-purpose identifier for
the in-app purchase transaction. After the purchase, you can use the order
number as a means of tracking the transaction in reconciliation reports and for
customer support.</p>

<p>The order number itself is a string consisting of numbers only, with a format
assigned and managed by Google.</p>

<p>For transactions dated 5 December 2012 or later, Google payments assigns a
Merchant Order Number (rather than a Google Order Number) and reports the Merchant
Order Number as the value of <code>orderId</code>. Here's an
example:</p>

<pre>"orderId" : "GPA.1234-5678-9012-34567"</pre>

<p>For transactions dated previous to 5 December 2012, Google checkout assigned
a Google Order Number and reported that number as the value of
<code>orderId</code>. Here's an example of an <code>orderId</code> holding a
Google Order Number:</p>

<pre>"orderId" : "556515565155651"</pre>

<h2 id="billing-testing-setup">Setting Up Test Accounts</h2>

<p>The Google Play Developer Console lets you set up one or more test accounts.
A test account is a regular Google account that you register on the Developer
Console as a test account. Test accounts are authorized to make in-app purchases
from apps that you have uploaded to the Google Play Developer Console
but have not yet published.</p>

<p>You can use any Google account as a test account. Test accounts are useful if you want to let
multiple people test In-app Billing on apps without giving them access to your publisher
account's sign-in credentials. If you want to own and control the test accounts, you can create the
accounts yourself and distribute the credentials to your developers or testers.</p>

<p>Test accounts have three limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test account users can make purchase requests only within apps that are already
  uploaded to your publisher account (although the app doesn't need to be published).</li>
  <li>Test accounts can only be used to purchase items that are listed (and published) in an
  app's product list.</li>
  <li>Test account users do not have access to your publisher account and cannot upload apps
  to your publisher account.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add test accounts to your publisher account, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Log in</a> to your publisher account.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>Locate the License Testing panel.</li>
  <li>Add the email addresses for the test accounts you want to register,
  separating each account with a comma.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save your profile changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="license_key">Getting an app's license key</h3>

<p>The Google Play Developer Console provides a public licensing key for each
app.</p>

<p>To locate the key for an app, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <strong>All applications</strong> panel.</li>
  <li>Click on the app name, then open the <strong>Services &amp; APIs</strong>
  page.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the section of the page labeled Your License Key for This
  Application, as shown in figure 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>Previously, the Developer Console provided a single public key per developer
account. To transition apps to the new per-app public key, the Developer Console
sets the app-specific key as the former developer key. This ensures compatibility
for apps that depend on the (former) developer key. </p>
