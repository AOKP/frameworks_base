<p>
  Along with new features, Android Wear 2.0 includes a variety of behavior
  changes. This document highlights some of the key changes to
  account for in your apps.
</p>

<p>
  If you have previously published an app for Android Wear, be aware that
  your app might be affected by these changes in the platform.

<h2 id="activity-dismissal">Activity Dismissal</h2>

<p>
  Starting in <a href="{@docRoot}wear/preview/index.html">Android Wear 2.0</a>,
  users dismiss apps and activities by using
  the power (stem) button on the watch.
  Long-pressing to dismiss an app is no longer suggested.
  Additionally, developers should not implement the
  long-press for dismissing
  <a href="{@docRoot}training/wearables/ui/exit.html">full screen</a>
  activities (panning or immersive activities such as Google Maps).
</p>

<p>
  In Android Wear 2.0, the power button of the watch is used
  to navigate back in the
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html">back stack</a>,
  including for full-screen panning activities.
  Before Android Wear 2.0, the <code>DismissOverlayView</code> class was
  used to implement the long-press for a user to dismiss an app.
  (The <code>DismissOverlayView</code> class was added to a layout
  for full-screen drawing and to draw over the other views.)
  Developers should test the power button for going back
  between an app's activities and for exiting an app.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, swipe for exiting an app or activity is not available.
  Developers can consider how their user interfaces
  can be enhanced with swipe-left and swipe-right,
  in a way similar to the functionality described for
  <a href="{@docRoot}wear/preview/features/ui-nav-actions.html">navigation
  drawers</a>.
