  <strong>New in Preview 2</strong>
</h3>

<h4 id="platform-version-24">
  Platform API Version
</h4>

<p>
  The Android Platform API version is incremented to 24 to match Android Nougat.
  You can update the following in your Android Wear 2.0 Preview project
  to <strong>24</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>compileSdkVersion</code></li>
  <li><code>targetSdkVersion</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="wearable-drawers">
  Wearable drawers
</h4>

<p>
  The following are feature additions for <a href=
  "{@docRoot}wear/preview/features/ui-nav-actions.html">
  wearable drawers</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drawer peeking is now supported in the <code>onCreate()</code> method
  of your app's activity.
  </li>

  <li>The automatic drawer peeking behavior is
  inverted. Now the bottom drawer peeks when the user scrolls down the view
  and top drawer peeks when the user scrolls to the top of the view
  (previously scrolling down did not show peek view).
  </li>

  <li>Two new attributes, <code>peek_view</code> and
  <code>drawer_content</code>, are added to
  <code>WearableDrawerView</code> to specify contents of custom drawers and
  peek view in your XML layout (previously, custom drawer contents were
  specified only through Java code).
  </li>

  <li>The Navigation drawer now displays page indicator dots.
  </li>

  <li>Peek views now close automatically after one second.
  </li>

  <li>The <code>WearableNavigationDrawer</code> now automatically closes
  after five seconds or when an item is tapped.
  </li>

  <li>There is improved drawer handling (size and margins) for devices with chins:
    <ul>
      <li>Size: The bottom drawer is slightly smaller when there is a
      chin.
      </li>
      <li>Margins: <code>WearableDrawerLayout</code> sets its bottom margin
      size equal to the size of the chin, so that the bottom drawer is
      fully visible.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>The navigation drawer contents are now updated when
        <code><a href="{@docRoot}reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html#notifyDataSetChanged()">
        notifyDataSetChanged</a></code> is called on the adapter.
  </li>

    <li>In your <code>WearableActionDrawer</code>, when there is only one
      action, its icon is shown in the peek view and the action is executed
      when the peek view is tapped.
    </li>

    <li>When the peek view of your <code>WearableActionDrawer</code> has
      more than one action, both the first action and the overflow icons are
      shown.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gestures">
  Wrist gestures
</h4>

<p>
  Wrist gestures can enable quick, one-handed interactions with your app.
  For example, a user can
  scroll through notifications with one hand while holding a cup of water
  with the other. For more information, see <a href=
  "{@docRoot}wear/preview/features/gestures.html">
  Wrist Gestures</a>.
